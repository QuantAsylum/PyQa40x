PyQa40x allows you to run Python code to communicate with the QA40x hardware. No intermediate program is needed, as the PyQa40x lib understands how to use the calibration data stored inside the QA40x hardware.

To get started, you can install the library in the Jupyter Lab environment by typing the following into a Juptyer Lab cell and the running the command:

```
!pip install git+https://github.com/QuantAsylum/PyQa40x.git
```

After the installation has finished, there are examples in the LibTest directory you can run.
